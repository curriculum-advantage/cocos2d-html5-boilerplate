# Cocos2d-html5 Boilerplate

It includes the build setup (Webpack and Cocos configurations, NPM scripts) along with an example
project structure, showing you how to preload assets and create nodes (e.g scenes, layers, sprites).

This repository provides a foundation for building HTML games with JavaScript that are bundled with
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), compiled with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/), and built on top of
the [Cocos2d-html](https://github.com/curriculum-advantage/cocos2d-html5) framework.

Note that as of
2019, both Cocos2d-html and Cocos2d-js
[are expected to be deprecated](https://discuss.cocos2d-x.org/t/cocos2d-cocos2d-html-vs-cocos-creator/45275)
in favor or Cocos Creator.

This boilerplate, in combination with [coconut](https://github.com/curriculum-advantage/coconut),
will hopefully provide teams with a way to continue developing on top of Cocos2d-html in a efficient
way.
