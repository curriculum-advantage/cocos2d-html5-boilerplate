# Overview

## About

For each game "title", we create a new repository. `cocos2d-html5-boilerplate` is the boilerplate repository that's cloned and used as a starting point for each of these new repositories.

## New Project Checklist

1. Clone the `cocos2d-html5-boilerplate` repository.
2. Update the `name` and `repository.url` properties in `package.json`.
3. Update the project structure and remove unnecessary files, if applicable.
4. Remove everything inside the `docs` directory.
5. Update the `HTML Game` title in the HTML file.
6. Update the `README.md`, which might look something like the following:

```markdown
# My Sample Game Title
